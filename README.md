# DNA
Not only is DNA a mobile application, but it also includes many backend features to make this app easy to use. For example, we have image-to-text recognition where the system analyses critical information within the text. It also takes that data and runs it through the database to cross-match with other patients diagnosed with the same characteristics. Well, ok, it does that, but what is a patient going to do with this? The goal of this app is to scan their gene report, where the system would scan it and run it through the database to match other patients that are relatively the same. This way, the patient can read about how they are doing, their struggles and how they recovered. Not only that, but after the system analyses essential information, it looks and matches a patient to a doctor catered to their needs. This is extremely helpful as some patients may want to talk to someone they know is experienced with some aspects of their diagnosis. Lastly, the theme for this year's hacks is restoration. Although this app implements restoration by referring patients to doctors, it also outputs tips and facts unique to the patient's report that would help the patient practice daily and be on the route to restoration to how they once were!
